# P01-EDA-titanic
Dive into the Titanic tragedy! Explore passenger data, visualize insights, and predict survival using logistic regression. Uncover hidden patterns and understand survival factors. Interactive visualizations &amp; clear code!

This project delves into the renowned Titanic passenger dataset, using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression to uncover fascinating insights and predict passenger survival probabilities. ‚ú®

# Key Highlights:

** In-Depth EDA:**
- Visualize key features like class, age, gender, embarkation port, and more.
- Uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data.
- Handle missing values.
Gain a deeper understanding of survival influencer variable.
‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing:
ü™Ñ Transform categorical features for machine learning.
ü©π Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, encoding).
‚öñÔ∏è Scale numerical features for optimal modeling.
** Logistic Regression for Survival Prediction:**
Build a robust model to predict passenger survival based on key features.
Evaluate performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Interpret model coefficients to understand feature impact on survival.
